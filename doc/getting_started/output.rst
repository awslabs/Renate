Renate's output
***************

The result of a Renate update job is written to the folder specified via the
:code:`next_state_url` attribute. This folder
contains the *Renate state*. It will be required for the next update job.

The Renate state folder contains three files:

.. list-table:: Renate Dataset Overview
    :header-rows: 1

    * - File
      - Description
    * - model.ckpt
      - This is the checkpoint of the trained model and the only file required for deployment.
        Use and `load this file <loading the updated model_>`_ to make predictions.
    * - learner.ckpt
      - This contains the state of the Renate updater. Only used by Renate.
    * - hpo.csv
      - A summary of all previous updates. The :code:`update_id` with highest value refers to the last update step.
        Among other things, it contains information about selected hyperparameters and logged metrics.
        It might be used in the next update step to accelerate the hyperparameter tuning step.

Loading the Updated Model
=========================

In the following, we refer with :code:`model_fn` to the function defined by the user in the
:doc:`Renate config file <how_to_renate_config>`.

Output Saved Locally
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If :code:`next_state_url` is a path to a local folder, loading the updated model can be done as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    from renate.defaults import current_state_folder, model_file

    my_model = model_fn(model_file(current_state_folder(next_state_url)))

Output Saved on S3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the Renate output was saved on S3, the model checkpoint :code:`model.ckpt` can be downloaded from

.. code-block:: python

    from renate.defaults import current_state_folder, model_file

    print(model_file(current_state_folder(next_state_url)))

and then loaded via

.. code-block:: python

    my_model = model_fn("model.ckpt")
