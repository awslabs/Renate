# Installation

Renate is available via PyPI and can be installed using `pip`:
```bash
pip install renate
```

Alternatively, if you want to access the code directly (e.g., for developing and running new methods)
it is possible to clone the git repository 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/awslabs/renate.git
```

We also recommend using a virtual environment to avoid conflicts in the 
versions of the packages installed. For example, following [these instructions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)
to use `venv`.
